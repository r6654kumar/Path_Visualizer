# Path Visualizer

This Path Visualizer Application helps you to visualize the following Graph / Tree Traversal Algorithms:

# Breadth First Searh
An algorithm used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, exploring all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It employs a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored, ensuring that the shortest path in an unweighted graph is found.

# Depth Search Algorithm
A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far along a branch as possible before backtracking, which can be implemented using a stack (either explicitly or via recursion). This approach is particularly useful for exploring paths and generating maze-like structures, though it may not find the shortest path in weighted graphs.

# Dijkstra's Algorithm
It is a popular method for finding the shortest paths from a source node to the destination node in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
